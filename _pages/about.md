My name is Po-Hsien Huang (黃柏僩), an Associate Professor in the [Department of Educational Psychology and Counseling](https://www.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/) at [National Taiwan Normal University](https://www.ntnu.edu.tw/). I received my Ph.D. degree in psychometrics from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/) under the supervision of Dr.[Li-Jen Weng](http://www.psy.ntu.edu.tw/index.php/members/faculty/fulltime-faculty/319-weng-li-jen)(翁儷禎) and [Hung Chen](http://www.math.ntu.edu.tw/entity_people/entity_people/21456)(陳宏). My research interest is in understanding how to correctly and efficiently apply structural equation modeling (SEM) and machine learning. In particular, I developed a framework for sparse estimation by penalized likelihood. The procedure can be easily conducted in R package [lslx](https://cran.r-project.org/package=lslx). Besides, I also apply both classical psychometric models and modern machine learning techniques for understanding human behaviors.
